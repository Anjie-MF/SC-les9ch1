## Project Title: Exclusive Potluck Party Website (JavaScript Edition)

## Description:
This project builds upon a previous website advertising a potluck party, adding an exclusive guest list and dish assignment functionality using JavaScript.

## Features:
âœ¦Limited Guest List: Only eight of my closest friends are invited, ensuring a chic and intimate gathering.

âœ¦Randomized Dish Assignment: A JS program leverages functions, loops, and the Math object to randomly assign dishes to each guest, eliminating conflicts over who brings what.

âœ¦Dish Uniqueness: The code prevents duplicate dish assignments by disabling buttons once a dish has been chosen.

## Technologies Used:
ðŸ”´HTML

ðŸ”´CSS

ðŸ”´JavaScript (event handlers, function expressions, querySelectorAll(), for...of loop, arrays, Math object, const, let)

## Starter Code:
